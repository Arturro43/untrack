Clean URLs, remove trackers, preserve privacy. 

## What is untrack?

Untrack is regex-based iOS shortcut that removes [tracking parameters](https://github.com/Arturro43/untrack/blob/main/readable-database.txt) from copied URLs.

Untrack is also fully open source database of most used tracking parameters like ?fbclid=, ?gclid=, ?si= and so on and so forth.

Every time you run Untrack it connects to this repo to get the newest database and then removes tracking parameters from URL in your clipboard. This probably gonna change soon.

## More info

Untrack uses two files from this repo - database.txt and version.txt. Database contains regex, version contains version number (duh). Version checking is planned in future.
